                JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language 
                that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich 
                (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and 
                the Mozilla Corporation).
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll 
                be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive 
                database-driven apps, and much more!
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have 
                written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking 
                a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, 
                providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; 
                collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 
                3D graphics and audio samples.
                </li>
                <li>
                Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites 
                from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate 
                    the work of building sites and applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to 
                present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the 
                tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, 
                as well as in other parts of MDN.
            </p>
            <p>
                The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to 
                play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!

            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! 
                As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a 
                new dimension of power and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging 
                than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, 
                and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript 
                to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the 
                standard for introductory programming examples.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Important: If you haven't been following along with the rest of our course, 
                download this example code and use it as a starting point.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, 
                create a new file called main.js, and save it.
                </li>
                <li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:
                    <pre class="brush: html notranslate line-numbers language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>scripts/main.js<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token script"></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>This is doing the same job as the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" title="The HTML External Resource Link element (<link>) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both &quot;favicon&quot; style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things."><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
                </li>
                <li>Add this code to the <code>main.js</code> file:
                    <pre class="brush: js notranslate line-numbers language-js"><code class=" language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> myHeading <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'h1'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                    myHeading<span class="token punctuation">.</span>textContent <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Hello world!'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code>index.html</code> in your browser. You should see something like this:<img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9543/hello-world.png" style="display: block; height: 236px; margin: 0px auto; width: 806px;">
                </li>
            </ul>

                To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, 
                let's explain some of the core features of the language. 
                It's worth noting that these features are common to all 
                programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, 
                you have a head start on coding in other languages too!
            </p>

            <p><strong>Important</strong>: In this article, try entering the 
            example code lines into your JavaScript console to see what happens. 
            For more details on JavaScript consoles,

            <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable">Variables</a> 
            are containers that store values. You start by declaring a 
            variable with the 
            <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></code> 
            (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the 
            <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">
            let</a></code> keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where 
            a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements 
            on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have 
            semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you 
            should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details,

            <article>
            <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. 
                The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments 
                in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
                <p>
                    <code class=" language-js"><span class="token comment">/*
                    Everything in between is a comment.
                    */</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">
                    <span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code>
                </p>
                <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to 
                    put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <code class=" language-js"><span class="token comment">// This is a comment</span>

            <p>An <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/operator">operator</a></code> 
            is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).

            examples to try in the JavaScript console.

                    <td>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a <code>true</code> into a <code>false</code>, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are <em>not</em> equal.</td>
                    <td><code>!</code>, <code>!==</code></td>
                    <td>
                        <p>For "Not", the basic expression is <code>true</code>, but the comparison returns <code>false</code> because we negate it:</p>

                        <p><code>let myVariable = 3;<br>
                        !(myVariable === 3);</code></p>

                        <p>"Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is <code>myVariable</code> NOT equal to 3". This returns<code> false</code> because <code>myVariable</code> IS equal to 3:</p>

                        <p><code>let <code>myVariable = 3;</code><br>
                        myVariable !== 3;</code></p>
                    </td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
            </table>
          <p>There are a lot more operators to explore, 
              but this is enough for now. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators">Expressions and operators</a> 
              for a complete list.
              </p>
            
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results 
            when performing calculations. Be careful that you are referring to your variables 
            correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, 
            enter <code>'35' + '25'</code> into your console. Why don't you get the result 
            you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, 
            so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. 
            If you enter <code>35 + 25</code> you'll get the total of the two numbers.
